I'm a junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, with a strong interest in hardware engineering, product design, and the intersection of technology and creativity. My academic background has introduced me to the exciting world of circuits, electronics, and power systems, and I’m driven to keep learning through both coursework and hands-on projects.

Outside the lab, I explore my creative side through digital art — a passion that helps me balance analytical thinking with visual expression. I believe engineering and art aren’t opposites; they complement each other. Whether I’m designing a circuit or sketching out ideas, I aim to bring thoughtful design and technical precision together in everything I create.

I'm especially passionate about entrepreneurship, building useful things, and contributing to projects that push ideas from prototype to reality.
