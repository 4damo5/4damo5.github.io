Projects
======

* [**Mindpixels AI — BR41N.io IEEE SMC Hackathon**](https://github.com/Union-Neurotech/mindpixels) | Python, JS, HTML, Flask, OpenCV, OpenAI API  
  Developed an EEG-to-video pipeline using Stable Video Diffusion. Built training datasets and collaborated on full-stack design to visualize brain activity in real time.
  
* [**Sheets2Spotify**](https://github.com/4damo5/Sheets2Spotify) | Python  
  Created a Python app that scrapes Google Form music entries, calls the Spotify API, and auto-generates a student playlist. Deployed at campus-wide Union College events.

* [**Album Mosaic**](https://github.com/4damo5/Album-Mosaic) | Python, Spotipy API  
  A small project that uses the Spotify API to collect album covers and generate mosaic art. The resulting image can be used as a phone background or decorative piece.

* [**RFID Solenoid Lock with Google Sheets Logging**](https://github.com/4damo5/RFID-Solenoid-Lock) | Python, Google API  
  An IoT-based RFID locking system built with a Raspberry Pi and Google Sheets integration. Tracks user access and includes a remote failsafe that allows unlocking via a Google Sheet checkbox.

STEM Outreach
======
* STEM Saturdays/STEP Program (Union College)
  * Weekly to Monthly STEM workshops for K-8 Students  
  * Combined accessibility and engagement to inspire future STEM learners  
  * Activities ranged from something as simple as doing paper airplane races to fabricating nightlights to take home
